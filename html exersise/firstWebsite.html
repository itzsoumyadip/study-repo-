<H1> This is  all about linux  </H1>
<h3>Linux</h3> <p> Is a family of free and open-source software operating systems built around the 
Linux kernel. Typically, Linux is packaged in a form known as a Linux distribution (or distro for short) for both desktop and server use. 
The defining component of a Linux distribution is the Linux kernel,</p><p>[11] an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, 
by Linus Torvalds.[12][13][14] Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name. The Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to 
refer to the operating system family, as well as specific distributions, to emphasize that most Linux distributions are not just the Linux kernel, 
and that they have in common not only the kernel, but also numerous utilities and libraries, a large proportion of which are from the GNU project. 
This has led to some controversy.[15][16]Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been
orted to more platforms than any other operating system.[17] Because of the dominance of the Linux kernel-based Android OS on smartphones, Linux has the 
largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems.

mainframe computers, and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers (since November 2017, having before gradually eliminated all competitors).[19][20] It 
is used by around 2.3% ofdesktop computers.[21][22] The Chromebook, which runs the Linux kernel-based Chrome OS, dominates the US Kâ€“12 education market and 
 represents nearly 20%of the sub-$300 notebook sales in the US.[23] Linux also runs on embedded systems, i.e. devices whose operating system is typically 
 built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system. This includes TiVo and similar DVR devices, network routers, facility automation controls, 
 televisions,[24][25] video game consoles and smartwatches.[26] Many smartphones and tablet computers run Android and other Linux derivatives.[27]

<h5>Precursors</h3></p>
<blockquote><p>Linus Torvalds</blockquote></blockquote>Principal author of the Linux kernel The Unix operating system was conceived and implemented in 1969, 
at AT&T's Bell Laboratories in the United States by <strong>Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie,</strong> Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna.[31] First released in 1971, Unix was written entirely in assembly language, as was common practice at the time. Later, in a key pioneering approach in 1973, it was rewritten in the C programming language by Dennis Ritchie (with the exception of some hardware and I/O routines). The availability of a high-level language implementation of Unix made its porting to different computer platforms easier.[32]
Due to an earlier antitrust case forbidding it from entering the computer business, AT&T was required to license the operating system's source code to anyone who asked.[33] As a result, Unix grew quickly and became widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses. In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs; freed of the legal obligation requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product, where users weren't legally allowed to modify Unix. The GNU Project, started in 1983 by Richard Stallman, had the goal of creating a "complete Unix-compatible software system" composed entirely of free software. Work began in 1984.[34] Later, in 1985, Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and wrote the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) in 1989. By the early 1990s, many of the programs required in an operating system (such as libraries, compilers, text editors, a Unix shell, and a windowing system) were completed, although low-level elements such as device drivers, daemons, and the kernel, called GNU/Hurd, were stalled and incomplete.[35]
Linus Torvalds has stated that if the GNU kernel had been available at the time (1991), he would not have decided to write his own.[36]
Although not released until 1992, due to legal complications, development of 386BSD, from which NetBSD, OpenBSD and FreeBSD descended, predated that of Linux. Torvalds has also stated that if 386BSD had been available at the time, he probably would not have created Linux.[37]
MINIX was created by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, a computer science professor, and released in 1987 as a minimal Unix-like operating system targeted at students and others who wanted to learn the operating system principles. Although the complete source code of MINIX was freely available, the licensing terms prevented it from being free software until the licensing changed in April 2000.[38]
